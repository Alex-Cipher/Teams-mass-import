# Teams-mass-import
PowerShell script to create a team in Teams and mass import users with roles

## How to use
1. first row is the team name
2. second row is the default channel with its users and roles
3. third row is to create the channels
4. fourth row is which kind of channel each channel is
5. I think the rest is self-explaining ;)
